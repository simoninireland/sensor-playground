* sensor-playground: An experimental framework forn target counting and higher-order sensor data analytics

  This repo contains code intended to explore /target counting and
  tracking/, a well-known "challenge problem" in sensor networking
  where a collection of sensors that can count, but not identify,
  targets in a local area co-operate to determine how many targets are
  actually present. The problem is that the sensors may overlap, or
  have gaps in coverage, so the answer is always an estimate and we
  ideally also need to determine how good an estimate it is. This is
  abstraction of several real-world problems, for example estimating
  wildlife abundance or determining the impact of faults in air
  traffic and other surveillance configurations.
